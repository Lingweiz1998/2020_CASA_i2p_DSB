### 1. Who collected the data?

The source for this database is from publicly available information on Airbnb's official website, and it was collected by Murray Cox, who found a website called Inside Airbnb, which is not affiliated with Airbnb. [1]

---

### 2. Why did they collect it?

Murray creates this database to analyse the use of Airbnb in certain cities over some time using maps and visualisations [1]. The database may therefore contain various geographic information (address), time information (booking times) and text information (descriptions of rooms, or reviews of residents).

---

### 3. How was it collected?

Inside Airbnb has made this database by collecting publicly available information displayed on the Airbnb website over a certain period. The data have been verified, cleansed, analysed and aggregated [1]. The content of the database is determined mainly by what the Airbnb website requires users to upload so that some optional-added information may be incomplete. At the same time, some data has been obfuscated at the time of collection for privacy purposes [1].

---

### 4. What useful information does it contain?


Firstly, the database contains information on the latitude and longitude of the housings, which is necessary for any spatial distribution based research. It is important to note that the Airbnb has obfuscated the location of the properties to protect privacy, so there is a margin of error of 0-450 feet in the locations. The database also contains the rent price for each housing, the number of days the property has been rented out over different periods (a month, a season, or a year), and how many rental properties the host owns and many other textual and digital data.

---

### 5. What useful information is it missing?

Inside Airbnb mentions in its webpage that there could be possible research on the comparison of rental patterns of the housings. Therefore, before opening the database, The author thought that we would be able to observe columns of data with an annual average of single rented days or a median number of rented days for each property. However, this information was not found in the data. The author also could not found the raw data, such as records of days for each rental that could calculate the average or the median. Moreover, the 'True or false' information as to whether the host lives in the property is considered by the author to be an essential data column. However, the database does not contain this information.

---

### 6. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

Inside Airbnb claims that its data allows researchers to explore how people use Airbnb. From that perspective, the database is mostly complete, but some critical information is missing. Firstly, as the website itself claims, the database can answer most of the fundamental questions such as where the property is located, how much it rents for, who owns the property and how many rental properties he/she owns. However, the website also claims that the database can answer questions such as whether the rental pattern is short or long term for properties, but does not contain enough information (average or median length of each rental housing) to show this feature. Additionally, the database also lacks accurate data on whether a host lives in their rental property.

---

### 7. What kinds of analysis would this support?

The database supports the spatial analysis of rental prices, for example, by exploring the relationship between the rental amount and the area in which the property is located. It is also possible to examine whether there is spatial clustering of prices and whether there is a relationship between prices clustering and the area or the properties are belong to the same hosts. Furthermore, the data can also provide an initial insight into the usage patterns of Airbnb hosts in the city. For example, do most hosts rent out their primary residence occasionally or do they own a large number of properties and use them only as a hotel.

---

### 8. What kinds of analysis would it _not_ support?

The database may not support analysis related to the study of rental-out patterns, as the information in the database does not allow us to determine whether a property is mainly used in a short-term or long-term rental pattern. This results in more alternative datasets for analysing the spatial distribution of the city's long-term and short-term rental patterns for clustering and exploring their relationship to other factors. At the same time, because the database lacks the necessary information, it cannot be accurately ascertained whether the host lives in the property or not. Therefore the host's usage patterns of the property cannot be accurately analysed.

### 9. Which of the uses presented in Q.7 and Q.8 are _ethical_?

Although people can manage their privacy settings on online public platforms such as Airbnb, in most cases, we are not able to manage our privacy well [2]. The reason is because of the extent to which many people do not know much about the data collection on the platform. Not only that, in the modern world, where big data analysis is rife, the combination of data from several different sources may reveal private information that people do not want to make public [3], [4]. In the case of Airbnb, because the hosts are required to show some of their personal information, their privacy is more likely to be disclosed after some analysis of the database than the consumers.\
In the vast majority of cases, the spatial analysis of housings for rental price does not involve personal information about the hosts. However, when analysing the host's housing usage patterns, the number of rental properties owned by the hosts will be used, which in combination with the price information may reveal some information about the hosts' assets. Not only that, but the distribution of one host's properties can also reveal areas where he/she is likely to be active in daily life. The assets or the daily active areas is the information that Airbnb does not mandatory for hosts to upload and make public. However, it can easily be disclosed in subsequent analysis. This raises ethical issues as we may have used unethical data in our research.
